abstract = {The use of intravascular tyrosine (TYR) to enhance catecholamine release in hemorrhagic shock and other cardiovascular diseases, or as a constituent of nutrient mixtures used for total parenteral nutrition, is limited by the unusually poor solubility of the amino acid in water. We have thus examined the ability of various TYRcontaining dipeptides, which are more water soluble than the amino acid, to raise serum TYR, to restore blood pressure in hemorrhaged hypotensive rats, and to lower blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). LTyrosylLproline (TYRPRO), LtyrosylLalanine (TYRALA), LalanylLtyrosine (ALATYR), and LtyrosylLtyrosine (TYRTYR) given intravenously (12.5-25 mg/kg) all caused significant increases in serum TYR; the increase after TYRPRO was dose related in the range 12.5-50 mg/kg. All of the dipeptides also caused significant elevations in blood pressure among hypotensive rats when administered intraarterially. Moreover, given intraperitoneally (100 mg/kg), all of them also lowered blood pressure in SHRs. These observations suggest that TYRcontaining dipeptides may be useful in some clinical situations where maintaining or elevating blood TYR levels would be desirable.},

abstract = {Lithium salts have a well-established role in the treatment of major affective disorders. More recently, experimental and clinical studies have provided evidence that lithium may also exert neuroprotective effects. In animal and cell culture models, lithium has been shown to increase neuronal viability through a combination of mechanisms that includes the inhibition of apoptosis, regulation of autophagy, increased mitochondrial function, and synthesis of neurotrophic factors. In humans, lithium treatment has been associated with humoral and structural evidence of neuroprotection, such as increased expression of anti-apoptotic genes, inhibition of cellular oxidative stress, synthesis of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), cortical thickening, increased grey matter density, and hippocampal enlargement. Recent studies addressing the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3B) by lithium have further suggested the modification of biological cascades that pertain to the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A recent placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) showed that long-term lithium treatment may actually slow the progression of cognitive and functional deficits, and also attenuate Tau hyperphosphorylation in the MCI-AD continuum. Therefore, lithium treatment may yield disease-modifying effects in AD, both by the specific modification of its pathophysiology via inhibition of overactive GSK3B, and by the unspecific provision of neurotrophic and neuroprotective support. Although the clinical evidence available so far is promising, further experimentation and replication of the evidence in large scale clinical trials is still required to assess the benefit of lithium in the treatment or prevention of cognitive decline in the elderly.},

abstract = {<jats:p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in elderly individuals and is associated with progressive neurodegeneration of the human neocortex. Thiamine levels and the activity of thiamine-dependent enzymes are reduced in the brains and peripheral tissues of patients with AD. Genetic studies have provided the opportunity to determine what proteins link thiamine to AD pathology (ie, transketolase, apolipoprotein E, upalpha-1-antitrypsin, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, p53, glycogen synthetase kinase-3upbeta, c-Fos gene, the Sp1 promoter gene, and the poly(ADP-ribosyl) polymerase-1 gene). We reviewed the association between histopathogenesis and neurotransmitters to understand the relationship between thiamine and AD pathology. Oral thiamine trials have been shown to improve the cognitive function of patients with AD; however, absorption of thiamine is poor in elderly individuals. In the early stage of thiamine-deficient encephalopathy (Wernicke's encephalopathy), however, parental thiamine has been used successfully. Therefore, further studies are needed to determine the benefits of using parental thiamine as a treatment for AD.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Currently, there are no effective therapies to ameliorate the pathological progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Evidence suggests that environmental factors may contribute to AD. Notably, dietary nutrients are suggested to play a key role in mediating mechanisms associated with brain function. Choline is a Blike vitamin nutrient found in common foods that is important in various cell functions. It serves as a methyl donor and as a precursor for production of cell membranes. Choline is also the precursor for acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter which activates the alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (upalpha7nAchR), and also acts as an agonist for the Sigma1 R (upsigma1R). These receptors regulate CNS immune response, and their dysregulation contributes to AD pathogenesis. Here, we tested whether dietary choline supplementation throughout life reduces ADlike pathology and rescues memory deficits in the APP/PS1 mouse model of AD. We exposed female APP/PS1 and NonTg mice to either a control choline (1.1\NBSPg/kg choline chloride) or a cholinesupplemented diet (5.0\NBSPg/kg choline chloride) from 2.5 to 10\NBSPmonths of age. Mice were tested in the Morris water maze to assess spatial memory followed by neuropathological evaluation. Lifelong choline supplementation significantly reduced amyloidupbeta plaque load and improved spatial memory in APP/PS1 mice. Mechanistically, these changes were linked to a decrease of the amyloidogenic processing of APP, reductions in diseaseassociated microglial activation, and a downregulation of the upalpha7nAch and upsigma1 receptors. Our results demonstrate that lifelong choline supplementation produces profound benefits and suggest that simply modifying diet throughout life may reduce AD pathology.</jats:p>},

abstract = {Maternal choline supplementation (MCS) improves cognition in Alzheimer's disease (AD) models. However, the effects of MCS on neuronal hyperexcitability in AD are unknown. We investigated the effects of MCS in a well-established mouse model of AD with hyperexcitability, the Tg2576 mouse. The most common type of hyperexcitability in Tg2576 mice are generalized EEG spikes (interictal spikes [IIS]). IIS also are common in other mouse models and occur in AD patients. In mouse models, hyperexcitability is also reflected by elevated expression of the transcription factor incrementFosB in the granule cells (GCs) of the dentate gyrus (DG), which are the principal cell type. Therefore, we studied upDeltaFosB expression in GCs. We also studied the neuronal marker NeuN within hilar neurons of the DG because reduced NeuN protein expression is a sign of oxidative stress or other pathology. This is potentially important because hilar neurons regulate GC excitability. Tg2576 breeding pairs received a diet with a relatively low, intermediate, or high concentration of choline. After weaning, all mice received the intermediate diet. In offspring of mice fed the high choline diet, IIS frequency declined, GC incrementFosB expression was reduced, and hilar NeuN expression was restored. Using the novel object location task, spatial memory improved. In contrast, offspring exposed to the relatively low choline diet had several adverse effects, such as increased mortality. They had the weakest hilar NeuN immunoreactivity and greatest GC upDeltaFosB protein expression. However, their IIS frequency was low, which was surprising. The results provide new evidence that a diet high in choline in early life can improve outcomes in a mouse model of AD, and relatively low choline can have mixed effects. This is the first study showing that dietary choline can regulate hyperexcitability, hilar neurons, upDeltaFosB, and spatial memory in an animal model of AD.},

abstract = {Much evidence indicates that the memory and cognitive deficits of patients with Alzheimer's disease are closely associated with dysfunction of central cholinergic system. The degree of reduction of choline acetyltransferase activity in cerebral cholinergic neurons is significantly correlated with the severity of dementia or cognitive impairments observed in Alzheimer's disease.

Here we show that choline acetyltransferase mediated by TAT protein transduction domain passes through the blood-brain barrier and enters the neurons in mice, increasing choline acetyltransferase and neurotransmitter acetylcholine contents. The recombination TAT-choline acetyltransferase fusion protein injected intravenously improves the memory and cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease model mice induced by amyloid-upbeta peptide.

Biotin is not synthesized by human cells, but it is found in food and is also produced by intestinal bacteria.

abstract = {Vitamins are organic compounds; they help in the regulation of many bodily functions like cell proliferation and differentiation, immunological response, and metabolism. A deficiency of these molecules can cause severe medical conditions, i.e., beriberi, xerophthalmia, scurvy, Crohn's disease, and others. Furthermore, studies have shown that vitamin deficiency might lead to many neuronal dysfunctions, even hampering the growth of neurons. This chapter explores the role of vitamins and their derivatives in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disease, and the cause of this disease is still unknown. However, several hypotheses try to explain the aetiology of the disease, such as A$\beta$ hypothesis, metal ion hypothesis, calcium homeostasis, cholinergic hypothesis, tau propagation, etc. Scientific literature reports several derivatives that show potential to treat Alzheimer's disease. Primarily these compounds act on nuclear receptors to activate ADAM10, inhibiting AChE or BuChE, neutralisation of ROS, inhibition of GSK-3, and amyloid-beta aggregation. Moreover, some can easily pass the BBB, which is crucial in targeting neurological disease. Vitamins and their derivatives show promising results in managing Alzheimer's disease, even several are in clinical trials.},

abstract = {<jats:p>Sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD) is the commonest cause of age-related neurodegeneration and dementia globally, and a leading cause of premature disability and death. To date, the quest for a disease-modifying therapy for sAD has failed, probably reflecting our incomplete understanding of aetiology and pathogenesis. Drugs that target aggregated Aupbeta/tau are ineffective, and metabolic defects are now considered to play substantive roles in sAD pathobiology. We tested the hypothesis that the recently identified, pervasive cerebral deficiency of pantothenate (vitamin B5) in sAD, might undermine brain energy metabolism by impairing levels of tricarboxylic acid (TCA)-cycle enzymes and enzyme complexes, some of which require the pantothenate-derived cofactor, coenzyme A (CoA) for their normal functioning. We applied proteomics to measure levels of the multi-subunit TCA-cycle enzymes and their cytoplasmic homologues. We analysed six functionally distinct brain regions from nine sAD cases and nine controls, measuring 33 cerebral proteins that comprise the nine enzymes of the mitochondrial-TCA cycle. Remarkably, we found widespread perturbations affecting only two multi-subunit enzymes and two enzyme complexes, whose function is modulated, directly or indirectly by CoA: pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, isocitrate dehydrogenase, 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, and succinyl-CoA synthetase. The sAD cases we studied here displayed widespread deficiency of pantothenate, the obligatory precursor of CoA. Therefore, deficient cerebral pantothenate can damage brain-energy metabolism in sAD, at least in part through impairing levels of these four mitochondrial-TCA-cycle enzymes.</jats:p>},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease remains one of the most complex and contested domains in biomedicine, characterized by fragmented findings, competing hypotheses, and limited translational success. We propose that AI can offer not just technical acceleration but a deeper epistemic contribution: reconciliation. Rather than optimizing predictive performance or replicating existing assumptions, the goal is to align disparate data, methods, and mechanistic insights into coherent models that explain how the disease emerges, progresses, and can be treated. This approach centers on digital twins, not as monolithic models, but as flexible, testable architectures grounded in homeostasis, destabilization, and multiscale coherence. Through an iterative, interoperable AI architecture, digital twins integrate evidence, resolve contradictions, and highlight where critical gaps remain. This framework moves beyond incremental progress within the prevailing model to catalyzing a paradigm shift in how Alzheimer's is understood. Reconciliation, in this sense, is not a method but a guiding principle for transforming both the science and its applications.},

abstract = {Despite decades of research, Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains without a curative therapy. While amyloid- and tau-centered approaches have dominated the field, failures of monotherapeutic strategies underscore the need for a broader system-level understanding. Here, this review critically revisits the principal hypotheses of AD pathogenesis, including the amyloid cascade, tauopathy, neuroinflammation, cholinergic dysfunction, oxidative and mitochondrial stress, metal dyshomeostasis, autophagy--lysosomal failure, genetic susceptibility, and infectious triggers. This review synthesizes molecular and cellular evidence from human genetics, neuropathology, and experimental models, correcting common misconceptions and emphasizing interactions between pathways. Neuroinflammation is increasingly recognized as a central hub linking amyloid, tau, and vascular factors, while mitochondrial and lysosomal dysfunctions emerge as amplifiers of proteotoxic stress. Genetic studies highlight apolipoprotein-E $\epsilon$4 (APOE $\epsilon$4) as the strongest common risk allele, but also implicate genes involved in endosomal trafficking, lipid metabolism, and immune regulation. Taken together, AD is best understood as a multi-hit disorder in which converging processes, rather than a single driver, dictate disease initiation and progression. This narrative review proposes a systems neurobiology framework that integrates these mechanisms and identifies key points of convergence amenable to therapeutic targeting and biomarker development. Finally, this reappraisal aims to inform future research directions and guide the rational design of multi-target interventions.},

abstract = {The development of effective therapeutics for Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias (ADRD) has been hindered by patient heterogeneity and the limitations of current diagnostic tools. New treatments have no chance of working if given to patients who cannot benefit from them. This perspective explores how advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly multimodal machine learning, can solve the 'Goldilocks problem' of identifying patients for inclusion in clinical trials and support precision treatment in real-world healthcare settings. We examine the challenges of patient stratification, grounded by a conceptual framework of identifying each person's stage and subtype of dementia. We review data from several clinical trials of Alzheimer's disease therapeutics, to explore how AI-guided patient stratification can improve trial outcomes, reduce costs and improve recruitment. Further, we discuss the integration of AI into clinical workflows, the importance of model interpretability and generalizability, and ethical imperative to address algorithmic bias. By combining AI with scientific insight, clinical expertise, and patient experience, we argue that intelligent analytics can accelerate the discovery and delivery of new diagnostics and therapeutics, ultimately transforming dementia care and improving outcomes for patients around the globe.},

abstract = {Molecules with vitamin K activity are important for optimal bone health. The major compound of this group in bone is vitamin K1 (phylloquinone), which is derived exclusively from plant foods in the diet. Vitamin K1 is absorbed along with dietary fat from the small intestine and transported by chylomicrons in blood. In serum obtained after an overnight fast from healthy men more than half of the vitamin K1 was recovered from the density fraction that contains chylomicrons and chylomicron remnants (CR), and only a quarter was associated with the major lipoprotein in serum, low density lipoprotein. The concentration of vitamin K1 in serum is closely related to the triglyceride concentration. Another determinant of vitamin K1 concentration in serum is the presence of specific variants of apolipoprotein E (apoE). ApoE is a small protein through which the vitamin K-rich CR bind to lipoprotein receptors. The three most common variants of apoE promote CR clearance from circulation with very different efficiency, in the order E2>E3>E4. The variant that promotes CR clearance best is associated with low vitamin K1 concentration in serum and increased response to vitamin K antagonists. Vitamin K1 concentration in serum is linked to vitamin K status of bone. The bone protein osteocalcin tends to be less completely carboxylated in people with low vitamin K concentrations in serum. Many hemodialysis patients with a history of bone fractures have indications of poor vitamin K status. The same patients also appear to have a greatly increased prospective bone fracture risk.},

A relative deficiency of vitamin K, affecting the extrahepatic functions of the vitamin, is common in ageing men and women. The concentration of vitamin K is lower in the circulating blood of APOE4 carriers than in that of persons with other APOE genotypes.

abstract = {<jats:p>Vitamin K is essential for many physiological processes, including coagulation, bone metabolism, tissue calcification, and antioxidant activity. Vitamin K vitamers are represented by lipophilic compounds with similar chemical structure (i.e., phylloquinone (vitamin K1) and menaquinone (vitamin K2)). Vitamin K deficiency can affect coagulation and vascular calcification, increasing the risk of hemorrhages, atherosclerosis, cerebrovascular diseases, and neurodegeneration. Recently, several studies have hypothesized a possible dual role of vitamin K vitamers in benefiting both vascular and cerebral health, e.g., by sphingolipids biosynthesis or ferroptosis inhibition. The aim of this narrative review is to deepen the understanding of biological activities of vitamin K and its possible dual protective/preventive actions in neurovascular and degenerative conditions, e.g., stroke and dementia. Given the difficulties related to hemorrhagic risk entailed in the prevention of strokes, the function of vitamin K antagonists is also investigated. Finally, we track the development of a clinical concept for a future preventive strategy and innovative use of vitamin K as a supplement to counteract neurovascular and pathological processes, focusing in particular on stroke and dementia.</jats:p>},

abstract = {Neurodegenerative disease refers to a group of disorders that predominantly damage the neurons in the brain. Despite significant progress in the knowledge of neurodegenerative diseases, there is currently no disease-modifying drug available. Vitamin K was first established for its involvement in blood clotting, but there is now compelling evidence indicating its role in the neurological system. In particular, the results of recent studies on the effects of vitamin K2 on preventing apoptosis, oxidative stress, and microglial activation in neuron cells through its role in electron transport are very promising against Alzheimer's disease. In addition to its protective effect on cognitive functions, its inhibitory effects on inflammation and $\alpha$-synuclein fibrillization in Parkinson's disease, which has been revealed in recent years, are remarkable. Although there are many studies on the mechanism and possible treatment methods of neurodegenerative diseases, especially Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, studies on the relationship between vitamin K and neurodegenerative diseases are very limited, yet have promising findings. Vitamin K has also been proposed for therapeutic use in multiple sclerosis patients to lower the intensity or to slow down the progression of the disease. Accordingly, the aim of this study is to review the current evidence for the use of vitamin K supplementation in neurodegenerative diseases, in particular Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT There are numerous reports in the literature of impaired gastrointestinal function with aging. However, most gastrointestinal functions remain relatively intact because of the large reserve capacity of the intestine, pancreas, and liver. Clinically important changes in gastrointestinal function with aging in human include decreased taste thresholds, hypochlorhydria due to atrophic gastritis, and decreased liver blood flow and size. Increased absorbability of lipids and large size molecules has been demonstrated in aging animals, but this has not been studied in humans. Nutrients with impaired gastrointestinal bioavailability in aging include dietary B-12, calcium carbonate, and ferric iron in atrophic gastritis; calcium, zinc, and possibly carbohydrate in a mixed meal. The implications of these changes for health maintenance and chronic disease in elderly people are in need of study.},

abstract = {In the absence of disease, the function of the gastrointestinal system is altered very little during aging. Few processes may be designated as inevitable, predictable, biological changes associated with normal aging independent of specific disease states (1). A reserve capacity exists for the gastrointestinal system minimizing the effect of most of the changes that occur with aging. A growing body of literature involving human studies has helped define the effect of age on gastrointestinal function, and has disproved myths and misconceptions when changes seen in animal models were extrapolated to the human condition. With the exception of reduced absorption of certain vitamins (A, D, K, and B6) and minerals (calcium and zinc), the aging process alone should not result in malnutrition, deterioration of nutritional status, or clinical symptomology resulting from dysfunction of the gastrointestinal system. However, a number of disease processes have an increased incidence with aging. Although these disease processes have nutritional implications for the geriatric population, they do not always require specific changes in nutritional therapy.},

abstract = {Proteins are essential biomolecules that play indispensable roles in maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating systemic metabolic processes. Protein deficiency is closely associated with age-related chronic diseases. Our purpose is to reveal the reason of protein deficiency in the elderly and potential treatments. A systematic literature search mainly on human studies addressing gastrointestinal aging and amino acid homeostasis was conducted. This review investigated the effects of aging on protein metabolism and summarized age-related physiological changes that collectively disrupt protein homeostasis. These changes include reduced secretion of gastric acid and digestive enzymes, which impair protein digestion in the stomach and small intestine. Weakened intestinal motility further delays the transit of digested proteins, reducing the efficiency of amino acid absorption. Additionally, decreased function of amino acid transporter proteins in the intestines and muscles limits the availability of amino acids for protein synthesis. Impaired liver and kidney function exacerbates these issues by affecting amino acid catabolism and clearance. Together, these alterations lead to an imbalance in amino acid homeostasis, contributing to protein deficiency, increasing the risk of sarcopenia in the elderly. Overall, we highlight changes in protein digestion, absorption, and amino acid metabolism in the elderly, and gives the possibility of improving amino acid utilization efficiency in the elderly, paving the way for new treatments for age-related protein deficiency in the future.},

abstract = {<jats:p>In recent decades, the global demographic landscape has undergone a discernible shift that has been characterised by a progressive increase in the proportion of elderly individuals, indicative of an enduring global inclination toward extended lifespans. The aging process, accompanied by physiological changes and dietary patterns, contributes to detrimental deviations in micronutrient consumption. This vulnerable aging population faces heightened risks, including dental caries, due to structural and functional modifications resulting from insufficient nutritional sustenance. Factors such as physiological changes, inadequate nutrition, and the prevalence of multiple chronic pathologies leading to polypharmacy contribute to the challenge of maintaining an optimal nutritional status. This scenario increases the likelihood of drug interactions, both between medications and with nutrients and the microbiome, triggering complications such as dental decay and other pathologies. Since the drug industry is evolving and new types of food, supplements, and nutrients are being designed, there is a need for further research on the mechanisms by which drugs interfere with certain nutrients that affect homeostasis, exemplified by the prevalence of caries in the mouths of older adults. Infectious diseases, among them dental caries, exert serious impacts on the health and overall quality of life of the elderly demographic. This comprehensive review endeavours to elucidate the intricate interplay among drugs, nutrients, the microbiome, and the oral cavity environment, with the overarching objective of mitigating the potential hazards posed to both the general health and dental well-being of older adults. By scrutinising and optimising these multifaceted interactions, this examination aims to proactively minimise the susceptibility of the elderly population to a spectrum of health-related issues and the consequences associated with dental decay.</jats:p>},

Moreover, 63 common potential targets between the two diseases were identified. Their pathogenesis involved cellular aging and endocrine metabolism regulation pathways, including AMPK, cell senescence, and the endocrine resistance pathway. This study identified an intimate correlation between frailty and sarcopenia in pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment measures, establishing a foundation for exploring shared prevention and treatment strategies for these two disorders.},

abstract = {Increasing markets for biopharmaceuticals, including monoclonal antibodies, have triggered a permanent need for bioprocess optimization. Biochemical engineering approaches often include the optimization of basal and feed media to improve productivities of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell cultures. Often, l-tyrosine is added as dipeptide to deal with its poor solubility at neutral pH. Showcasing IgG1 production with CHO cells, we investigated the supplementation of three l-tyrosine (TYR, Y) containing dipeptides: glycyl-l-tyrosine (GY), l-tyrosyl-l-valine (YV), and l-prolyl-l-tyrosine (PY). While GY and YV led to almost no phenotypic and metabolic differences compared to reference samples, PY significantly amplified TYR uptake thus maximizing related catabolic activity. Consequently, ATP formation was roughly four times higher upon PY application than in reference samples.},

abstract = {Nutritional management is essential for patients with inborn errors of metabolism, such as urea cycle disorders (UCDs). Lack of appetite is common in these patients and can lead to underconsumption of calories, catabolism, and subsequently loss of metabolic control. The etiology of anorexia in these patients is largely unexplored. The neuroendocrine hormone peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY), secreted postprandially from endocrine cells of the ileum and colon, induces feelings of satiety and decreases food intake. While plasma PYY levels have been characterized in a number of populations, they have not been examined in UCD patients. In a retrospective study, plasma PYY concentrations were measured in UCD (n=42) patients and controls (n=28) via an ELISA to determine if levels of this anorexigenic hormone are altered in this patient population. Median PYY levels were significantly higher in UCD patients compared to controls (p=3.510(-5)). Body mass index was significantly associated with increased PYY levels in controls (p=0.02), while UCD diagnosis subtype was associated with PYY levels (p=110(-3)) in cases. Median PYY levels were significantly lower in ornithine carbamoyltransferase deficient patients compared with all other UCD subtypes (p=910(-3)), but significantly higher compared to controls (p=1.610(-3)). Overall, this study demonstrates that UCD cases have increased PYY levels compared to controls, suggesting that regulation of PYY may be altered in these patients. These observations may lead to a better understanding of the development of anorexia in UCD patients.},

Gastric bypass is an effective surgical treatment but carries significant perioperative risks. The gut hormones, peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY) and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), are elevated following gastric bypass and have been shown to reduce food intake.

abstract = {The severity of aortic stenosis (AS) can be overestimated in high-flow states, and thiamine deficiency is an underrecognized cause of high-output circulatory states. We report two elderly females who developed thiamine deficiency-related high-output circulatory states, initially leading to an overestimation of AS severity. Case 1 was assessed as severe but was downgraded to moderate after thiamine replacement, and case 2 was initially assessed as moderate but was reclassified as mild after treatment. Case 1 had a history of gastrectomy, predisposing her to thiamine deficiency due to limited postoperative intake and a more alkaline gastric environment. Case 2 had liver cirrhosis and was on long-term spironolactone and loop diuretics, contributing to thiamine depletion via renal losses and impaired gastrointestinal utilization. Both patients exhibited refractory edema and hyperdynamic left ventricular wall motion. Thiamine deficiency impairs adenosine triphosphate production, reducing systemic vascular resistance and triggering compensatory high-output circulatory states. Prompt thiamine replacement improved symptoms and hemodynamic parameters. These cases highlight the importance of recognizing reversible high-flow states to avoid misinterpretation of AS severity and ensure accurate evaluation and management.},

Vitamin K (VK) is a multifunctional micronutrient with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, whose deficiency may cause age-related diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases and osteoporosis. There is a growing body of evidence supporting the role of vitamin K as a protective nutrient in aging and inflammation. This review summarizes the current knowledge regarding the molecular aspects of the protective role of vitamin K in aging and age-related diseases and its clinical implications.},
