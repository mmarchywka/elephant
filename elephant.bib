abstract = {The use of intravascular tyrosine (TYR) to enhance catecholamine release in hemorrhagic shock and other cardiovascular diseases, or as a constituent of nutrient mixtures used for total parenteral nutrition, is limited by the unusually poor solubility of the amino acid in water. We have thus examined the ability of various TYRcontaining dipeptides, which are more water soluble than the amino acid, to raise serum TYR, to restore blood pressure in hemorrhaged hypotensive rats, and to lower blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). LTyrosylLproline (TYRPRO), LtyrosylLalanine (TYRALA), LalanylLtyrosine (ALATYR), and LtyrosylLtyrosine (TYRTYR) given intravenously (12.5-25 mg/kg) all caused significant increases in serum TYR; the increase after TYRPRO was dose related in the range 12.5-50 mg/kg. All of the dipeptides also caused significant elevations in blood pressure among hypotensive rats when administered intraarterially. Moreover, given intraperitoneally (100 mg/kg), all of them also lowered blood pressure in SHRs. These observations suggest that TYRcontaining dipeptides may be useful in some clinical situations where maintaining or elevating blood TYR levels would be desirable.},

abstract = {Increasing markets for biopharmaceuticals, including monoclonal antibodies, have triggered a permanent need for bioprocess optimization. Biochemical engineering approaches often include the optimization of basal and feed media to improve productivities of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell cultures. Often, l-tyrosine is added as dipeptide to deal with its poor solubility at neutral pH. Showcasing IgG1 production with CHO cells, we investigated the supplementation of three l-tyrosine (TYR, Y) containing dipeptides: glycyl-l-tyrosine (GY), l-tyrosyl-l-valine (YV), and l-prolyl-l-tyrosine (PY). While GY and YV led to almost no phenotypic and metabolic differences compared to reference samples, PY significantly amplified TYR uptake thus maximizing related catabolic activity. Consequently, ATP formation was roughly four times higher upon PY application than in reference samples.},

abstract = {Nutritional management is essential for patients with inborn errors of metabolism, such as urea cycle disorders (UCDs). Lack of appetite is common in these patients and can lead to underconsumption of calories, catabolism, and subsequently loss of metabolic control. The etiology of anorexia in these patients is largely unexplored. The neuroendocrine hormone peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY), secreted postprandially from endocrine cells of the ileum and colon, induces feelings of satiety and decreases food intake. While plasma PYY levels have been characterized in a number of populations, they have not been examined in UCD patients. In a retrospective study, plasma PYY concentrations were measured in UCD (n=42) patients and controls (n=28) via an ELISA to determine if levels of this anorexigenic hormone are altered in this patient population. Median PYY levels were significantly higher in UCD patients compared to controls (p=3.510(-5)). Body mass index was significantly associated with increased PYY levels in controls (p=0.02), while UCD diagnosis subtype was associated with PYY levels (p=110(-3)) in cases. Median PYY levels were significantly lower in ornithine carbamoyltransferase deficient patients compared with all other UCD subtypes (p=910(-3)), but significantly higher compared to controls (p=1.610(-3)). Overall, this study demonstrates that UCD cases have increased PYY levels compared to controls, suggesting that regulation of PYY may be altered in these patients. These observations may lead to a better understanding of the development of anorexia in UCD patients.},

abstract = {The global obesity epidemic has resulted in significant morbidity and mortality. However, the medical treatment of obesity is limited. Gastric bypass is an effective surgical treatment but carries significant perioperative risks. The gut hormones, peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY) and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), are elevated following gastric bypass and have been shown to reduce food intake. They may provide new therapeutic targets. This review article provides an overview of the central control of food intake and the role of PYY and GLP-1 in appetite control. Key translational animal and human studies are reviewed.},
