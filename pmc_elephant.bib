abstract = {Increasing markets for biopharmaceuticals, including monoclonal antibodies, have triggered a permanent need for bioprocess optimization. Biochemical engineering approaches often include the optimization of basal and feed media to improve productivities of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell cultures. Often, l-tyrosine is added as dipeptide to deal with its poor solubility at neutral pH. Showcasing IgG1 production with CHO cells, we investigated the supplementation of three l-tyrosine (TYR, Y) containing dipeptides: glycyl-l-tyrosine (GY), l-tyrosyl-l-valine (YV), and l-prolyl-l-tyrosine (PY). While GY and YV led to almost no phenotypic and metabolic differences compared to reference samples, PY significantly amplified TYR uptake thus maximizing related catabolic activity. Consequently, ATP formation was roughly four times higher upon PY application than in reference samples.},

abstract = {Nutritional management is essential for patients with inborn errors of metabolism, such as urea cycle disorders (UCDs). Lack of appetite is common in these patients and can lead to underconsumption of calories, catabolism, and subsequently loss of metabolic control. The etiology of anorexia in these patients is largely unexplored. The neuroendocrine hormone peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY), secreted postprandially from endocrine cells of the ileum and colon, induces feelings of satiety and decreases food intake. While plasma PYY levels have been characterized in a number of populations, they have not been examined in UCD patients. In a retrospective study, plasma PYY concentrations were measured in UCD (n=42) patients and controls (n=28) via an ELISA to determine if levels of this anorexigenic hormone are altered in this patient population. Median PYY levels were significantly higher in UCD patients compared to controls (p=3.510(-5)). Body mass index was significantly associated with increased PYY levels in controls (p=0.02), while UCD diagnosis subtype was associated with PYY levels (p=110(-3)) in cases. Median PYY levels were significantly lower in ornithine carbamoyltransferase deficient patients compared with all other UCD subtypes (p=910(-3)), but significantly higher compared to controls (p=1.610(-3)). Overall, this study demonstrates that UCD cases have increased PYY levels compared to controls, suggesting that regulation of PYY may be altered in these patients. These observations may lead to a better understanding of the development of anorexia in UCD patients.},

abstract = {The global obesity epidemic has resulted in significant morbidity and mortality. However, the medical treatment of obesity is limited. Gastric bypass is an effective surgical treatment but carries significant perioperative risks. The gut hormones, peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY) and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), are elevated following gastric bypass and have been shown to reduce food intake. They may provide new therapeutic targets. This review article provides an overview of the central control of food intake and the role of PYY and GLP-1 in appetite control. Key translational animal and human studies are reviewed.},

abstract = {The severity of aortic stenosis (AS) can be overestimated in high-flow states, and thiamine deficiency is an underrecognized cause of high-output circulatory states. We report two elderly females who developed thiamine deficiency-related high-output circulatory states, initially leading to an overestimation of AS severity. Case 1 was assessed as severe but was downgraded to moderate after thiamine replacement, and case 2 was initially assessed as moderate but was reclassified as mild after treatment. Case 1 had a history of gastrectomy, predisposing her to thiamine deficiency due to limited postoperative intake and a more alkaline gastric environment. Case 2 had liver cirrhosis and was on long-term spironolactone and loop diuretics, contributing to thiamine depletion via renal losses and impaired gastrointestinal utilization. Both patients exhibited refractory edema and hyperdynamic left ventricular wall motion. Thiamine deficiency impairs adenosine triphosphate production, reducing systemic vascular resistance and triggering compensatory high-output circulatory states. Prompt thiamine replacement improved symptoms and hemodynamic parameters. These cases highlight the importance of recognizing reversible high-flow states to avoid misinterpretation of AS severity and ensure accurate evaluation and management.},
