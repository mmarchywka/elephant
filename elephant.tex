not ready at all
The AD literature seems to go from miracle to failed miracle almost
daily with little attempt to integrate the observations and try
to put them together with cause and effect like any TV detective
or old wisdom fables like the blind men and the elephant even as
done by Natalie Merchant lol. This work tries to fix that 
and finds that all these things are logically explained by 
well known issues such as age related digestive decay.
Suggestions are further supported by in-house work on 
optimization of dog diets demonstrating apparent safety
and utility of out of favor vitamins that could be impacted
by changes in stomach chemistry. 
Another problem may be politics. One issue may be related
to tyrosine metabolism and increased relative
abundance of analogs capable of become toxic. This immediately
jumps out as a contributor to race based AD differences not
just social aspects that are touted to be politically correct.
To be sure, constituitive tyrosine metabolizers may have adaptive
responses which support this flux with no net "bad" effects
elsewhere and theere may turn out not to be any anwyay. 
In any case, its an important issue and like any other
law of nature will not yield to human desire and the only way
for people to benefit is follow the data. 
If you want to fool society insead of solve problems for everyone
turn back now to your safe space...

\begin{abstract}
Effective treatments for Alzheimer's Disease have been difficult
to create. Much effort has been directed at amyloid beta removal
with minimal clinical benefits.
Several alternative approaches have become popular including
the infection hypothesis although many pathogens appear to 
be possible causes. 
An age related vulnerability rather than a small group of pathogens
may be a better focus for attention. 
Over various time spans, a series of headlines
has emerged claiming benefits for various nutrients or supplements
such as thiamine, choline, lithium, or NAD+. 
Taking  these and other  observations
together it is likely that, similar to the fable of the blind men
grasping different part of an elephant, a plausible unifying
theme is nutrient deficiency with adaptive and malapative 
responses making this initial cause difficult to discern.
This work explains all of these disparate observations as
the result of age related GI decay. If this analysis accurately
captures cause and effect in the real disease, correction
or prevention may be fairly easy with well known small 
nutrient molecules or addition of acid or chloride to meals.
Isolated profound nutrient deficiencies will not likely exist
so obvious attribution of disease to single molecular entity is not
appropriate.  Individual responses to nutrient details will 
appear to make each case different but still possibly treatable
with similar simple remedies. 
Indeed, there has been some limited success with dietary interventions
but these fail to be designed around likely age related causes.
It may not be possible get all required nutrients from food once
damage to digestive system has occured.
Cations such as metals, protein components, and lipophilic nutrients
would likely be the first suspects. In particular, its likely that
vitamin K and copper, along with more accepted components such
as amino acids and SMVT substrates all need to be included
to replace the younger absorption profile.  However, brute
force supplementation without regard to formulation
may not work due to chemical and metabolic interactions.  
Two important amino acids with solubility issues in particular,
tyrosine and tryptophan, and critical but reactive metals such
as copper may require special attention. There are also possible
political concerns if there is a hesitancy to link tyrosine metabolism
to dementia that must be ignored if progress is to be achieved.

\section{Introduction  }
Alzheimer's disease remains an unresolved problem despite
all the money and effort directed at it for the last
several decades.  
Despite decades of development, anti-amyloid products continue
to show questionable net clinical benefit and do not always
get FDA approval even with creative trial design.
Headlines sometimes appear about new scientific or anecdotal
evidence pointing to a new treatment but rarely do these
translate into useful therapies. The thesis of this work
is that many of these results are useful but tend to be
interpretted in isolation and without regard for cause
and effect in real disease.
"Animal models" may mimic some features of real disease but
are predicated on a cause unlikely to be relevant to 
the pathology being treated. By coincidence, sometimes however
results may be transferable but don't seem to add to understanding.


In the search for alternatives to the amyloid hypotheses,
a number of other ideas have been generated. 
A variety of metabolic ideas have been considered.

Genetics have been investigated too with APOE contuining
to get most of the attention. 

As no particularly good suspect has emerged, it may be worth
lookin at all the data and trying to guess at age related
vulnerabilities that cause more infections to lead to dementia
and classic symptoms such as amyloid build ups. Nutritional 
defects make some sense as frailty, more than age per se,
may be a correlate of age related diseases.

The GLP-1 data may also motivate an interest. GLP-1's apparently
are causing non-specific nutrient deficiencies maybe similar to
problems common in old age. Clinical trials showed either no
benefit in AD or a positive trial
\cite{Edison_Femminella_Ritchie_Liraglutide_mild_2025}
 appeared to be cherry picked.
Meanwhile anecdotes about an aged appearance ( " Ozempic face" )
and brain fog persist. There are a lot of lessons here but the
immediate thing of relevance is that nutrient limitation that
is can be "plausibly denied" appears to generate some symptoms
of aging and more to the point frailty.

Evidence pointing towards a cognitive benefit for GLP-1's may
be a bit misleading. In one case, they were run against
sulfonylureas which have known relevant side effects.
In other cases, words suggesting a cognitive benefit in actuality
mean that some risk factor has been reduced without 
clear evidence of real clinical benefit against dementia.



Women and blacks appear to be at higher risk of AD 
than European males. 
Factors unrelated to the disease per se may confound results
but that is the case with even politically correct association
studies. 

One obvious issue with skin pigment is tryosine metabolism.
Both the depltion of tyrosine and generation of toxic analogs
could be considered. It is possible that constituitive
skin pigmentation (CSP)  evolved with adaptive mechanisms that
may be instructive to investigate.   While CSP may predispose
to various maladies, it may also be easily treated if
existing adpatations are not already active. Indeed,
speculation on beneficial tyrosine analogs can not be dismissed.
 

Tyrosine anecdotes around menopause may be one indicator.
While not considered essential as it can be derived from 
phenyalanine, it is possible that overall supply of the precursor
and regulatory systems reduce tyrosine production pathologically.
This is most likely during times of "stress" and shortages.
Interestingly in connection with GLP-1 there is a tyrosine
dipeptide apparently acting as a signalling molecule
Amino acids such as tyrosine may have limited availability
in cell cultures and dipeptides have been explored 
\cite{Kang_Mullen_Miranda_Utilization_tyrosine_2012} for many years now.
Also of interest is the need to supplement tyrosine as
a dipeptide to Chinese hamseter ovary cells in bioreactors
\cite{PMC7481768}
with work showing possible pickiness of cells for uptake
although translation to human GI tract remains to be done.
Similar problems have been noted for tyrosine usage in humans
from either IV injection or parenteral feeding \cite{MAHER1990685}.
Tyrosine-tyrosine peptide is considered a hormone and may
be responsible for anorexia in urea cycle disorder patients
\cite{PMC3336020}.
Indeed GLP-1 is often considered with PYY for understanding obesity
signalling \cite{PMC3286726}. While its unclear if PYY can replace
the GLP-1 drugs, if supplementation is attempted it will benefit
a lot from recognizing the issues explored here. Dipeptides or
reproduction of "best' GI chemistry may be more important than
simply adding tyrosine to diet.


Copper has a lot of motivation behind it but its rich chemistry
may make it one of the more difficult to study.

For whatever reason, vitamin K is often ignored even though 
interactions with APOE and appearance in "healthy" foods
motivates at least an association with health.


Choline has also made recent headlines

adding to a long history for it 
\cite{Velazquez_Ferreira_Knowles_Lifelong_choline_supplementation_ameliorates_2019}
\cite{10.7554/eLife.89889}
and related pathways 
\cite{FU2004258} including cholinesterase inhibitors
\cite{Dementia_CognitiveImprovementGroup_Cholinesterase_inhibitors_Alzheimer_2016}.



Thiamine is also being considered \cite{Fessel_Supplemental_thiamine_2021}
and that too is through to have acid sensitive absorption
\cite{PMC12811047}.
A 2012 study did show some benefits from supplementation in the
elderly but due to poor absorption parental dosing was
mentioned 
\cite{quUx1ed1badcharvv7889cLuong_Hoang_Role_Thiamine_2011}.
It seems that many studies on isolated nurients have come to
similar conclusions but not attempted to think through cause
and effect more generally. 
A 1988 study claimed to use a niacinamide placebo 
\cite{Blass_Thiamine_Alzheimer_1988}
which  motivates another problem of an unintentionally active
placebo.
And in fact niacinamide has been discussed as a treatment too
\cite{Klotter_Niacinamide_nicotinamide_Alzheimer_2010}. 


	Lithium has recently been rediscovered 
\cite{Aron_Ngian_Qiu_Lithium_deficiency_2025}
although positive review articles date back to at least 2012
\cite{Forlenza2012} or so 
\cite{Matsunaga_Kishi_Annas_Lithium_Treatment_2015} 
and its not clear what happened over the intervening decade.

In 1971, it was observed that lithium could impact
carbohydrate generally and inositol status in the brain
\cite{ALLISON_STEWART_Reduced_Brain_Inositol_1971}.
In another manuscript considering inositol as a dog supplement
( unpublished result ) 

but as of 2005 it could not be determined if lithium or
inositol was more directly causal to brain changes
that matter in the clinic
\cite{Harwood_Lithium_bipolar_mood_2005}.
This is likely a recurring issue in Alzheimer's and medicine
overall. Associations are difficult to map to an actionable
cause and effect sequence that can be beneficially modified.
It is the main theme of this work that the primary cause
is well removed from these associations and the elephant
is not apparent from the sum of its parts. 
It is likely that both inositl and lithium are 
impacted by some common cause and simply supplementing one
or the other or both can make some improvements but is a deadend
to a cure.




\mjmtol{
}

A 2025 article found ADAMTS2 to be one of the  genes
robustly  increased  in black and European Alzheimer's brains 
\cite{Teich_Tobunluepop_Troncoso_Novel_differentially_expressed_genes_2025}.
Essentially this translates into pervasive "weak structural proteins"
as described below. 


APOE is associated with many vitamins including vitamin K.



Fermented foods meet many of the criteria for obtaining nutrients
with age impaired digestions. They tend to have low pH, and can even
include pH as part of the definition, and essential molecules  such as free
amino acids and vitamin k. 

Olive oil has been an important part of in-house dog diets 
( manuscript in preparation ) as well as being a highlighted
component of the Mediterranean Diet. A variety of possible causal
pathways could be imagined for it but here it is considered
somewhat uniquely, along with lecithin and phophates,
as an absorption enhancer.

\section{ Statement of Conflicts }
 No specific funding was used in this effort and there are no relationships
with others that could create a conflict of interest. I would like to develop
these ideas further and have obvious bias towards making them appear 
successful. Barbara Cade, the dog owner, has worked in the pet food industry
but this does not likely create a conflict. We have no interest in the
makers of any of the products named in this work.

\section{About the Authors and Facility}
This work was performed at a dog rescue run by Barbara Cade and
housed in rural Georgia.  The author of this report 
,Mike Marchywka,
has a background in electrical engineering and 
has done extensive research using free online literature sources.  
I hope to find additional people interested in critically 
examining the results and verify that they can be reproduced
effectively to treat other dogs.
